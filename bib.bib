abstract = {Collaborative problem-solving has been gaining attention as more and more students and employees work together all around the world to find solutions to complex problems. This trend goes hand in hand with a growing interest in the role of affective processes in learning and problem-solving fields. However, the comprehension of real-time dynamics between emotional sharing and collaborative exchanges (what we propose to call “collaborative act”) still needs to be deepened. The challenge is especially on understanding the interplay between real-time changes in epistemic and relational dimensions. In this study, we propose to explore this question in dyadic creative problem-solving. Eleven pairs of participants used an argument graph tool to co-create a slogan against violence at school. The tool was used to write down slogans and build a joint map of the group argumentation. During the collaboration, they had access to an emotion awareness tool, allowing them to share emotional labels in real time. An indicator of real-time use was computed to track ongoing changes in collaborative acts during collaboration. Then, using both inferential and descriptive statistics, we first investigated whether emotional sharing induces real-time adaptation of both emitter's and receiver's collaborative acts. Second, we looked at privileged relationships between emitter's collaborative acts, emitter's emotion sharing, and receiver's collaborative acts. The preliminary results obtained (1) confirm that emotional sharing regulates emitter's and receiver's collaborative acts and (2) strongly suggest that specific emotions mark specific patterns of collaboration in different collaborative phases, implying both the epistemic and the relational spaces of collaboration. These results highlight the value of studying emotional sharing for a deeper comprehension of the factors regulating collaborative problem-solving. Perspectives in educational psychology and computer science are considered, with the will to understand and promote better self- and co-regulation of collaborative problem-solving through emotional sharing.},

@article{Jarvela2020,
abstract = {Collaborative learning (CL) can be a powerful method for sharing understanding between learners. To this end, strategic regulation of processes, such as cognition and affect (including metacognition, emotion and motivation) is key. Decades of research on self-regulated learning has advanced our understanding about the need for and complexity of those mediating processes in learning. Recent research has shown that it is not only the individual's but also the group's shared processes that matter and, thus, that regulation at the group level is critical for learning success. A problem here is that the “shared” processes in CL are invisible, which makes it almost impossible for researchers to study and understand them, for learners to recognize them and for teachers to support them. Traditionally, research has not been able to make these processes visible nor has it been able to collect data about them. With the aid of advanced technologies, signal processing and machine learning, we are on the verge of “seeing” these complex phenomena and understanding how they interact. We posit that technological solutions and digital tools available today and in the future will help advance the theory underlying the cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and social components of individual, peer and group learning when seen through a multidisciplinary lens. The aim of this paper is to discuss and demonstrate how multidisciplinary collaboration among the learning sciences, affective computing and machine learning is applied for understanding and facilitating CL.},

Existing emotion awareness tools offer little information on learners' emotions and their antecedents. This study created an emotion-reporting grid for university students based on the emotions they experienced daily. Students were interviewed based on their self-reported grid. A quantitative descriptive analysis of these retrospective interviews was conducted based on Pekrun's control-value theory of achievement emotions. Student transcripts were analyzed based on the focus of their emotions (retrospective, activity, or prospective), the causes they attribute to their emotions (agent or external circumstances) and how they appraised the situation in which they experienced the emotions (value and control). We discuss the results with regard to the types of emotion-oriented and appraisal-oriented regulation strategies used in learning contexts and draw implications for the design of emotion awareness tools to support emotion regulation processes.},

abstract = {Students can experience a variety of emotions while completing assessments. Some emotions can get in the way of students performing their best (e.g., anxiety, frustration), whereas other emotions can facilitate student performance (e.g., engagement). Many new, non-traditional assessments, such as automated conversation-based assessments (CBA), are designed with the intention to create a test-taking experience that maximizes beneficial emotions for students and minimizes detrimental emotions. However, there is a paucity of research on students' actual emotional experiences during these non-traditional assessments. Across two studies, we investigated students' moment-to-moment emotions during two CBAs that differed on construct (science inquiry, mathematical reasoning) and environment (virtual world, chat box). We found a similar set of emotions to frequently occur across the two studies and came to the preliminary conclusion that students have a generally positive experience with CBAs and that boredom, confusion, curiosity, delight, engagement/flow, frustration, happiness/enjoyment, hope, and pride are the prevalent emotions in CBAs. The temporal dynamics of emotions as well as the emotion-performance relationship were also investigated across the two studies. Lastly, we discuss how these findings can inform the development of emotion-sensitive CBAs that can facilitate students being able to perform to the best of their ability.},

abstract = {In CSCL systems, students who are solving problems in group have to negotiate with each other by exchanging proposals and arguments in order to resolve the conflicts and generate a shared solution. In this context, argument construction assistance is necessary to facilitate reaching to a consensus. This assistance is usually provided with isolated arguments by demand, but this does not offer students a real and integral view of the conflicts. In this work, we study the utilisation of argumentation plans to assist a student during the argumentation. The actions of an argumentation plan represent the arguments that a student might use during the argumentation process. Moreover, these plans can be integrated with the tasks needed to reach a shared solution. These plans give the student an integral and intuitive view of the problem resolution and the conflict that must be resolved. We evaluated our proposal with students of an Artificial Intelligence course. This evaluation was carried out by comparing three different assistance scenarios in which students had to solve exercises: no assistance, assistance with isolated arguments, and assistance with argumentation plans. The results obtained show that reaching consensus was easier for the students when the assistance was provided using argumentations plans. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Specifically, the robot either intervened by repairing a task-directed or personal attack by a confederate or did not intervene. Contrary to our expectations, we found that the robot's repair interventions increased the groups' awareness of conflict after the occurrence of a personal attack thereby acting against the groups' tendency to suppress the conflict. These findings suggest that repair heightened awareness of a normative violation. Overall, our results provide support for the idea that robots can aid team functioning by regulating core team processes such as conflict.},

Within Piagetian theory, the cognitive conflict of ideas between students is seen as beneficial for learning. Which sorts of interpersonal behaviors lead to most effective learning, however, is open to debate, with some researchers arguing that cooperation is most effective and others arguing that interpersonal conflict is a natural part of collaborative learning.

abstract = {The aim of our study was to gain understanding of different types of conflicts on knowledge in the discussions of problem-based learning tutorial groups, and how such conflicts are dealt with. We examined first-year medical and dental students' (N = 33) conflicts on knowledge in four videotaped reporting phase tutorials. A coding scheme was created for analysing verbatim transcripts of 43 conflict episodes in order to find out whether the conflict episodes were about factual or conceptual knowledge and how the students elaborated the knowledge. Conflict episodes were relatively rare (taking up 7. 6 {\%} of the time) in the videotaped groups. Conflict episodes were more frequently about factual knowledge (58 {\%}) than conceptual knowledge (42 {\%}), but conflicts on conceptual knowledge lasted longer and were more often elaborated. Elaboration was, however, more frequently done individually than collaboratively. Conflict episodes were generally fairly short (mean duration 28 s). This was due to a lack of thorough argumentation and collaborative elaboration of conflicting ideas. The results suggest that students' skills to bring out differences in each other's conceptual thinking, the depth of argumentation and the use of questions that elicit elaboration need to be improved. Tutors' skills to facilitate the collaborative resolving of conflicts on knowledge call for further study. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The emphasis on building co-operative/collaborative environments has brought out the matter of group interactions. This, in its turn, has highlighted the issue of conflicts, inherent to group problem solving. If well employed, conflicts can act as triggers of cognitive changes, and thus help to refine the group's solution to the task. In this paper, we present a computational framework for detecting and mediating Meta-Cognitive conflicts. The theoretical framework presented here enables a computational system to analyse the ongoing interaction, to detect and mediate conflicts. In order to do so, we consider our model of strategic changes, a model of the group, and the history of the interaction. The objective of the mediation is to suggest courses of action that provoke articulation and reflection, and thus lead to more refined solutions. In order to diagnose which changes are happening to the group plan we have built a model of strategic operations, which describes what types of changes happen to a plan as well as how changes to one component of the strategy (beliefs, intentions, ordering relations, context beliefs and goals) impact the other ones.

abstract = {Group cognitive conflicts occur when a learner in a collaborative mobile learning environment becomes aware of a discrepancy between his/her existing cognitive framework and new information or experience. The cognitive conflicts stimulate the learning process by making an individual to move from his/her learning sphere and participate with others in the learning process. However, there is a big challenge on how students handle and resolve conflicts during collaborative learning. Intelligent agents have been used in this paper to provide support for group interactions by regulating the group conflicts. An experimental design with one control group and two experimental groups (role playing and guided negotiation) is used to compare levels of group knowledge construction. The findings showed improved levels of knowledge construction where regulated conflicts were used compared to where they were not used.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis and opinion mining is an area that has experienced considerable growth over the last decade. This area of research attempts to determine the feelings, opinions, emotions, among other things, of people on something or someone. To do this, natural language techniques and machine learning algorithms are used. This article discusses the problem of extracting sentiment and opinions from a collection of reviews on scientific articles conducted under an international conference on computing in northern Chile. The first aim of this analysis is to automatically determine the orientation of a review and contrast this with the assessment made by the reviewer of the article. This would allow scientists to characterize and compare reviews crosswise and more objectively support the overall assessment of a scientific article. A hybrid approach that combines an unsupervised machine learning algorithm with techniques from natural language processing is proposed to analyze reviews. This method uses part-of-speech (POS) tagging to obtain the syntactic structure of a sentence. This syntactic structure, along with the use of dictionaries, allows determining the semantic orientation of the review through a scoring algorithm. A set of experiments were conducted to evaluate the capability and performance of the proposed approaches relative to a baseline, using standard metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. The results show improvements in the case of binary, ternary and a 5-point scale classification in relation to classical machine learning algorithms such as SVM and NB, but they also present a challenge to improve the multiclass classification in this domain.},

abstract = {User behaviors in online social networks convey not only literal information but also one's emotional attitudes towards the information. To compute this attitude, we define the concept of emotion role as the concentrated reflection of a user's online emotional characteristics. Emotion role detection aims to better understand the structure and sentiments of online social networks and support further analysis, e.g., revealing public opinions, providing personalized recommendations, and detecting influential users. In this article, we first introduce the definition of a fine-grained emotion role, which consists of two dimensions: emotion orientation (i.e., positive, negative, and neutral) and emotion influence (i.e., leader and follower). We then propose a Multi-dimensional Emotion Role Mining model (MERM) to determine a user's emotion role in online social networks. Specifically, we tend to identify emotion roles by combining a set of features that reflect a user's online emotional status, including degree of emotional characteristics, accumulated emotion preference, structural factor, temporal factor, and emotion change factor. Experiment results on a real-life micro-blog reposting dataset show that the classification accuracy of the proposed model can achieve up to 90.1{\%}.},

This dictionary is created using labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from both source and target domains. Next, this dictionary is used to classify the unlabeled reviews of the target domain. The work is carried out in Hindi, the official language of India. The web pages in Hindi language is booming after the introduction of UTF-8 encoding style. When compared with labeling done by Hindi Sentiwordnet (HSWN), a general lexicon for word polarity, the proposed method is able to label 23–24{\%} more number of words of target domain. The labels assigned by our method and the labels given by HSWN, for the available words, are compared and found matching with 76{\%} accuracy.},

Finding attentive comments that provide some reasoning is highly valuable in understanding the user's opinion particularly in sociopolitical opinion mining and aids policy makers, social organizations or government sectors in decision making. In this paper we study the problem of detecting thoughtful comments. We empirically study various textual features, discourse relations and relevance features to predict thoughtful comments. We use logistic regression model and test on the datasets related to sociopolitical content. We found that the most useful features include the discourse relations and relevance features along with basic textual features to predict the comment quality in terms of thoughtfulness.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.Electronic detection of linguistic negation in free text is a challenging need for many text handling applications including sentiment analysis. Our system uses online news archives from two different resources namely NDTV and The Hindu to predict the scope of negation in the text. In this paper, our main target was on determining the scope of negation in news articles for two political parties namely BJP and UPA by using three existing methodologies. They were Rest of the Sentence (RoS), Fixed Window Length (FWL) and Dependency Analysis (DA). The F measures for each one of them were 0.58, 0.69 and 0.75 respectively. We observed that DA was performing better than the other two. Among 1675 sentences in the corpus, according to annotator I, 1,137 were positive and 538 were negative whereas according to annotator II, 1,130 were positive and 545 were negative. Further we also identified the score of each sentence and calculated the accuracy on the basis of average score of both the annotators. The scope of negation detection was limited to specific rather than implicit negations within single sentences.},

Inspired by affective computing and active listening strategy, in this paper, a research and application framework of recognizing emotion based on textual interaction is presented first. Second, an emotion category model for e-learners is defined. Third, many Chinese metaphors are abstracted from the corpus according to the sentence semantics and syntax. Fourth, as the strategy of active learning, topic detection is used to detect the first turn in dialogs and recognize the type of emotion in the turn, which is different from the traditional emotion recognition approaches that try to classify every turn into an emotion category. Fifth, compared with Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, LogitBoost, Bagging, MultiClass Classifier, RBFnetwork, J48 algorithms and their corresponding cost-sensitive approaches, Random Forest and its corresponding cost-sensitive approaches achieve better results in our initial experiment of classifying the e-learners' emotions. Finally, a case-based reasoning for emotion regulation instance recommendation is proposed to guide the listener to regulate the negative emotion of a speaker, in which a weighted sum method of Chinese sentence similarity computation is adopted. The experimental result shows that the ratio of effective cases is 68{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis is about classifying opinions expressed in text. The aim of this study is to improve polarity classification of sentiments in microblogs by building adaptive sentiment lexicons. In the proposed method, corpora-based and lexicon-based approaches are combined and lexicons are generated from text. The sentiment classification is formulated as an optimization problem, in which the goal is to find optimum sentiment lexicons. A novel genetic algorithm is then proposed to solve this optimization problem and find lexicons to classify text. The algorithm generates adaptive sentiment lexicons, and then a meta-level feature is extracted based on it, which is then used alongside Bing Liu's lexicon and n-gram features. The experiments are conducted on six datasets. In terms of accuracy, the results outperform the state-of-the-art methods proposed in the literature in two of the datasets. Also, in four of the datasets, the proposed approach outperforms in terms of F-measure. Applying the proposed method on six datasets, the accuracy is higher than 80{\%} in all six datasets and the F-measure is higher than 80{\%} in four of these datasets. Using the sentiment lexicons created by the proposed algorithm, one can get a better understanding of the specific language and culture of Twitter users and sentiment orientation of words in different contexts. It is also shown that it is useful not to omit the conventional stop-words, as each word can have its sentimental implications.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis and opinion mining are valuable for extraction of useful subjective information out of text documents. These tasks have become of great importance, especially for business and marketing professionals, since online posted products and services reviews impact markets and consumers shifts. This work is motivated by the fact that automating retrieval and detection of sentiments expressed for certain products and services embeds complex processes and pose research challenges, due to the textual phenomena and the language specific expression variations. This paper proposes a fast, flexible, generic methodology for sentiment detection out of textual snippets which express people's opinions in different languages. The proposed methodology adopts a machine learning approach with which textual documents are represented by vectors and are used for training a polarity classification model. Several documents' vector representation approaches have been studied, including lexicon-based, word embedding-based and hybrid vectorizations. The competence of these feature representations for the sentiment classification task is assessed through experiments on four datasets containing online user reviews in both Greek and English languages, in order to represent high and weak inflection language groups. The proposed methodology requires minimal computational resources, thus, it might have impact in real world scenarios where limited resources is the case.},

abstract = {Conflict management influences individual well-being, group performance and organizational effectiveness. This research examined the psychometric qualities of two versions of the newly developed test for conflict handling (the Dutch Test for Conflict Handling). The lean version (Study 1 and 2) included problem solving, forcing, yielding and avoiding as distinct conflict management strategies, and the expanded version (Study 3) also included compromising. A negotiation study (Study 1 with 78 psychology students) showed substantial convergence between self-reports, opponent-reports and observer rated behavior for problem solving, forcing and yielding, but not for avoiding. In Study 2 with 308 employees and Study 3 with 2,403 professionals, the psychometric properties were examined of the lean and the expanded version, respectively. Confirmatory factor analyses revealed good to excellent psychometric qualities of both versions of the scale. We conclude that the scale is a parsimonious, flexible and valid instrument to assess conflict management strategies at work. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Task conflict is usually associated with effective decisions, and relationship conflict is associated with poor decisions. The 2 conflict types are typically correlated in ongoing groups, however, which creates a prescriptive dilemma. Three explanations might account for this relationship--misattribution of task conflict as relationship conflict, harsh task conflict tactics triggering relationship conflict, and misattribution of relationship conflict as task conflict. The authors found that intragroup trust moderates the relationship between task conflict and relationship conflict in 70 top management teams. This result supports the "misattribution of task conflict" explanation. The authors also found a weak effect that is consistent with the argument that tactical choices drive the association between the 2 conflict types. We infer that trust is a key to gaining the benefits of task conflict without suffering the costs of relationship conflict.},

abstract = {This study examines the structure of 105 work groups and management teams to address the question of whether conflict can be beneficial. Multiple methods were used to examine the effects of conflict on both individual- and group-level variables to provide a more refined model of intragroup conflict. Results show that whether conflict was beneficial depended on the type of conflict and the structure of the group in terms of task type, task interdependence, and group norms. Relationship and task conflicts were negatively associated with individuals' satisfaction, liking of other group members, and intent to remain in the group. In groups performing very routine tasks, disagreements about the task were detrimental to group functioning. In contrast, in groups performing nonroutine tasks, disagreements about the tasks did not have a detrimental effect, and in some cases, such disagreements were actually beneficial. Contrary to expectations, norms encouraging open discussion of conflict were not always advantageous. The results suggest that while such norms were associated with an increase in the number and intensity of relationship conflicts, they did not increase members' ability to deal with the conflicts constructively. The model developed here contributes to an integrated perspective on organizational conflict.},

It is hypothesized that visualization of participation could contribute to successful CSCL. A CSCL-environment was augmented with the Participation Tool (PT). The PT visualizes how much each group member contributes to his or her group's online communication. Using a posttest-only design with a treatment (N = 52) and a control group (N = 17), it was examined whether students with access to the PT participated more and more equally during collaboration, reported higher awareness of group processes and activities, collaborated differently, and performed better than students without access to the PT. The results show that students used the PT quite intensively. Furthermore, compared to control group students, treatment group students participated more and engaged more in coordination and regulation of social activities during collaboration by sending more statements that addressed the planning of social activities. However, equality of participation, awareness of group processes and quality of the group products was not higher in the treatment condition. Still, the results of this study demonstrate that visualization of participation can contribute to successful CSCL. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The process leading to fission is viewed as an unequal flow of sentiments and information across the ties in a social network. This flow is unequal because it is uniquely constrained by the contextual range and sensitivity of each relationship in the network. The subsequent differential sharing of sentiments leads to the formation of subgroups with more internal stability than the group as a whole, and results in fission. The Ford-Fulkerson labeling algorithm allows an accurate prediction of membership in the subgroups and of the locus of the fission to be made from measurements of the potential for information flow across each edge in the network. Methods for measurement of potential information flow are discussed, and it is shown that all appropriate techniques will generate the same predictions.},

@article{Webb2012,
abstract = {The present review adopts an action control perspective on emotion regulation, contextualising the gap between emotion control goals (e.g., I want to remain calm) and emotional outcomes (e.g., anger, anxiety, and aggression) in terms of the broader literature on goal pursuit. We propose that failure to effectively regulate emotions can result from difficulties with the self-regulatory tasks of (i) identifying the need to regulate, (ii) deciding whether and how to regulate, and (iii) enacting a regulation strategy. Next we review evidence that a technique traditionally associated with regulating behavioural goals (forming implementation intentions or ‘‘if-then'' planning) can help to overcome these difficulties. Meta-analysis indicated that forming implementation intentions is effective in modifying emotional outcomes, with a large effect relative to no regulation instructions (k ¼ 21, N ¼ 1306 dþ ¼ 0.91, 95{\%} CI ¼ 0.61 to 1.20) and a medium-sized effect relative to goal intention instructions (k ¼ 29, N ¼ 1208, dþ ¼ 0.53, 95{\%} CI ¼ 0.42 to 0.65). Our conclusion is that research on emotion regulation might benefit from an action control perspective and the interventions that this perspective offer},

The purpose of this study was to explore and understand student interaction in successful collaborative learning during a university course which was mediated by two different types of virtual learning environment. Through a qualitative case study, we examined how students interacted with each other while working with collaborative tasks. Results indicate that interaction in collaborative situations was more often group-related than task-related. Group-related interaction concentrated mostly on coordination of group work, such as planning and organising group activities. Task-related interaction was mostly in the form of comments or answers to earlier messages. However, there were differences in the interaction forms according to the learning environment. The results of this study provide teachers, educators and educational coordinators guidelines for how to organise and enhance successful collaborative learning both virtually and face-to-face.},

abstract = {Students' ability to regulate their learning is considered important for the quality of collaborative inquiry learning. However, there is still limited understanding about how students engage in social forms of regulation processes and what roles these regulatory processes may play during collaborative learning. The purpose of this study was to identify when and how co- and shared regulation of metacognitive, emotional and motivational processes emerge and function during collaborative inquiry learning in science. Two groups of three students (aged 12) from a private primary school in Turkey were videotaped during collaborative inquiry activities in a naturalistic classroom setting over a seven-week period, and the transcripts were analysed in order to identify their use of regulation processes. Moreover, this was combined with the analysis of stimulated-recall interviews with the student groups. Results indicated that co- and shared regulation processes were often initiated by particular events and played a crucial role in the success of students' collaborative inquiry learning. Co-regulation of metacognitive processes had the function of stimulating students to reflect upon and clarify their thinking, as well as facilitating the construction of new scientific understanding. Shared regulation of metacognitive processes helped students to build a shared understanding of the task, clarify and justify their shared perspective, and sustain the ongoing knowledge co-construction. Moreover, the use of shared emotional and motivational regulation was identified as important for sustaining reciprocal interactions and creating a positive socio-emotional atmosphere within the groups. In addition, the findings revealed links between the positive quality of group interactions and the emergence of co- and shared regulation of metacognitive processes. This study highlights the importance of fostering students' acquisition and use of regulation processes during collaborative inquiry learning.},

abstract = {Socio-cognitive conflict has been defined as a situation of confrontation with a disagreeing other. Previous research suggests that individuals can regulate conflict in a relational way, namely by focusing on social comparison between relative levels of competences. Relational conflict regulation has been described as yielding particularly negative effects on social interactions and learning, but has been understudied. The present research addresses the question of the origin of relational conflict regulation by introducing a fundamental distinction between two types of regulation, one based on the affirmation of one's own point of view and the invalidation of the other's (i.e., 'competitive' regulation), the other corresponding to the protection of self-competence via compliance (i.e., 'protective' regulation). Three studies show that these modes of relational conflict regulation result from the endorsement of distinct performance goals, respectively, performance-approach goals (trying to outperform others) and performance-avoidance goals (avoiding performing more poorly than others). Theoretical implications for the literature on both conflict regulation and achievement goals are discussed.},

abstract = {Although Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is regarded as an effective pedagogical approach, this heavily depends on whether its members function effectively as a group. This study examines whether students' interpersonal skills and students' perceptions of those skills predict individual achievement and group performance in CSCL-environments. In total, 87 secondary education students working in 29 triads collaborated on a collaborative problem-solving task. Students' interpersonal skills and the perception of students' interpersonal skills were conceptualized as agency (displaying dominant behavior, e.g., leadership) and communion (displaying empathic behavior, e.g., being helpful). Students' interpersonal skills were measured by coding the chat-utterances of the group discussions. Perceptions of interpersonal skills were measured by administering a questionnaire after the group task. Individual achievement was measured by a pre-test and a post-test. Group performance was measured by coding the quality of the problem-solution. Multi-level analysis revealed that, when corrected for pre-test scores, students' agency and communion skill positively predict their individual achievement. Multiple regression analysis revealed that the group level scores for collaborative behavior, interpersonal skill perception, and pre-test scores did not significantly predict group performance. The results suggest that students' interpersonal skills significantly predict the degree to which CSCL has an impact student individual achievement.},

abstract = {Research emphasizes cognitive processes as they occur in social contexts. In light of this focus, it is critical that we also consider the social interactions and interpersonal dynamics that contribute to group activity (Barron, 2003). Previous findings differentiate a guiding form of other-regulation conceptualized in the extant literature (i.e., facilitative other-regulation), from a directive form during which a group member manages and controls the regulatory processes for the group (Rogat {\&} Adams-Wiggins, 2014; Volet {\&} Mansfield, 2006). The current study aims to investigate whether the interrelations between regulatory processes and their socioemotional interactions, and how they unfold over the course of group activity, differ for groups characterized by facilitative or directive other-regulation. Two small groups of middle school students who varied in their form of other-regulation were observed during three collaborative tasks within an inquiry-based science curricular context. Results indicated that directive other-regulators used primarily negative socioemotional interactions in line with their control-oriented regulatory aims and initiated highly critical exchanges marked by socially comparative remarks, as well as provoked disrespectful reactions from group members. In contrast, facilitative other-regulators proactively fostered positive socioemotional interactions by being inclusive of everyone's ideas and advocating for the respect of alternative perspectives. Taken together, the other-regulator played a predominant role in setting the socioemotional tone and used socioemotional interactions as a means to fulfill regulatory aims.},

abstract = {This study extends prior research on both individual self-regulation and socially shared regulation during group learning to examine the range and quality of the cognitive and behavioral social regulatory sub-processes employed by six small collaborative groups of upper-elementary students (n = 24). Qualitative analyses were conducted based on videotaped observations of groups across a series of three mathematics tasks. Variation in the quality of social regulation as a function of group processes (positive and negative socioemotional interactions, collaborative and non-collaborative interactions) was also considered. Findings suggested that the synergy among the social regulatory processes of planning, monitoring, and behavioral engagement was important for differentiating quality variation between groups. Positive socioemotional interactions and collaboration also appeared to facilitate higher quality social regulation. Implications for comprehensively supporting high quality social regulation, alongside positive socioemotional interactions and collaboration, in small group contexts are discussed.},

abstract = {In order to determine how emotions and cognition are experienced during collaborative group work online students' descriptions of their learning experience were interpreted using a qualitative approach. A common feature of these accounts was reference to difficulties and problems. Four main themes were identified from this data set. Two of the themes, 'Constraints on autonomy' and 'Reflections about collaboration', encapsulate the experience of engaging in group work. The other two themes 'Virtual others' and 'Communicating online'. The 'impact on progress and achievement' provide some insight into what is unique about the socio-emotional experience of collaborating online and how it can influence motivation and learning. The findings were considered from two perspectives of the role of emotion in learning: the socio-cognitive model of self-regulated learning and the community of inquiry framework (COI). An interdisciplinary approach was adopted by taking into account recent research in social cognitive neuroscience. Some practical recommendations about the deployment of technologies for group work online and for empowering students' understanding of the value of collaborative learning are made. The value of verbal immediacy practices as a way of counteracting the disembodied nature of the relational experience of others online is discussed. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Nevertheless, few studies classify and analyze the research findings of the community to explicitly show the real impact and use of affective states in CSCL environments. Thus, this paper presents the development of a systematic mapping of the literature to answer three questions: (i) What are the affective states frequently used in CSCL environments? (ii) Were affective states in CSCL environment empirically evaluated? (iii) What are the types of environments that use affective states to support group learning? To answer these questions, seven digital libraries were queried and 31 studies were deeply analyzed. As main results, we verified that: (i) 54,84{\%} of the studies deal with 'emotions' in CSCL environments, (ii) 51,61{\%} of the studies were empirically evaluated, and (iii) LMS (38,71{\%}) and E-Learning systems (22,58{\%}) are the most common types of environments that use affective states to support collaborative learning. Finally, we also identified gaps and opportunities to conduct research on adaptive/intelligent CSCL systems to support better group formation and customization of group activities using affective states.},

Altogether 33 participating university students were interviewed. The data were analysed using qualitative inductive and deductive content analysis. Three student profiles were identified: 1) self-regulated students not using co-regulation, 2) actively co-regulating students with average self-regulation skills, and 3) students with self-regulation problems relying on co-regulation. Self-regulated students not using co-regulation showed evidence of excellent self-regulation skills and deep-level processing, whereas actively co-regulating students with average self-regulation skills showed an active use of co-regulation of learning, some problems in self-regulation, and challenges in deep processing. Students with self-regulation problems relying on co-regulation emphasised other students' support when studying, and exhibited surface-level processing. The results imply that by recognising the profiles of university students it is possible to identify those who may be at risk and in need of more support in their studying.},

abstract = {Learning is a social process. That is why it is extremely important to understand how students interact socially in online courses and how it affects the learning process. However, social aspects, understood as those expressions or comments that go beyond strictly academic interaction, i.e. the need to carry out group work, are not clearly defined. Researchers have proposed different models of categories to observe or measure social aspects. This paper contributes to this field through addressing the categorization of social expression in online groups through a qualitative research procedure. Specifically, 19 indicators have been identified and organized into 4 categories: formal, attitudinal, emotional and informal. The findings suggest that those indicators related to formal and attitudinal aspects appear more often than emotional and informal ones. Different profiles (Psychology or Computer Engineering) as well as different levels of experience in online learning (beginners or experts) have also been analyzed, concluding that Psychology students turn to social expressions more often than Computer Engineering ones. As students progress in their undergraduate studies, social expressions are perceived and used to the extent that they ease the learning process. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate the differences between the groups with respect to the amount and the types of challenges. One case group was chosen (one that experienced more and particularly socio-emotional challenges) for the in-depth interaction analysis. Their overruling, status-centric, undermining and normative interaction created a socio-emotional conflict.

Results showed that the EAT stimulated participants to engage in a mutual modeling of emotions. In the EAT condition, the perceived amount of time spent on emotion modeling process was positively correlated to the perceived intensity of positive emotions after collaboration. The EAT increased the perceived degree of transactivity, but only for women.

This study aims to explore how groups progress in their socially shared regulation of learning (SSRL) in the context of computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Teacher education students (N = 103) collaborated in groups of three to four students during a two-month multimedia course. The groups used the Virtual Collaborative Research Institute (VCRI) learning environment along with regulation tools that prompted them to recognize challenges that might hinder their collaboration and to develop SSRL strategies to overcome these challenges. In the data analysis, the groups reported challenges, and the SSRL strategies they employed were analyzed to specify the focus and function of the SSRL. Process discovery was used to explore how groups progressed in their SSRL. The results indicated that depending on the phase of the course, the SSRL focus and function shifted from regulating external challenges towards regulating the cognitive and motivational aspects of their collaboration. However, the high-performing groups progressed in their SSRL in terms of evidencing temporal variety in challenges and SSRL strategies across time, which was not the case with low performing groups.},

We examine how regulation occurs within this collaboration. A synchronous computer-supported collaborative learning environment (CSCL) facilitated peer discussion at a distance using a combination of tools that included video-conferencing, chat boxes, and a shared whiteboard to support collaborative engagement. We examine regulation along a continuum, spanning from self- to co-regulation, in situations where medical students learn how to manage their own emotions and adapt their responses to patient reactions. We examine the nature of the discourse between medical students and facilitators to illustrate the conditions in which metacognitive, co-regulation and social emotional activities occur to enhance learning about how to communicate bad news to patients.},

abstract = {This case study was conducted in two high school classrooms that utilized collaborative project-based learning (PBL). Collaboration is an important instructional strategy, especially used in conjunction with PBL, and is an essential learning outcome for the twenty-first century. This study examined how collaboration can be achieved as a learning outcome and used effectively as an instructional method by understanding what causes task-, process-, and relationship-related intragroup conflict and how social skills are related to intragroup conflict and collaboration at both the individual and group levels. Literature suggests that, while task-related conflict serves as a catalyst for collaboration, process- and relationship-related conflicts are detrimental to collaboration and impede learning. Social interdependence theory suggests that social skills play an important role in enhancing collaboration and resolving conflicts. Data were collected through online questionnaires and follow-up interviews. Interview data were analyzed using a qualitative data analysis approach. The survey data were analyzed using multi-level structural equation modeling, which allowed us to reveal an interesting relationship between group-level social skills and collaboration. Results suggest that different individual difference factors triggered each type of conflict, and most of the groups experienced more than one type of conflict simultaneously. Task and process conflicts were often transformed into relationship conflict, when social skills were lacking. Interestingly, group-level social skills were more influential than individual members' social skills in reducing intragroup conflict and enhancing collaboration. {\textcopyright} 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract = {This study explored what social interactions students exhibited during collaborative learning, and analyzed how the social interactions evolved in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment. Six groups (n = 28) from an undergraduate online course were observed during a semester. Students' interactions were analyzed in two perspectives: group regulation and socioemotional. Cluster analysis was conducted to identify collaboration patterns of the groups. The analysis identified three collaborator clusters: one good and two poor. The good collaborators (named Early Active Collaborator) demonstrated: (1) intensive interactions among group members in the early collaboration phase, (2) positive socio-emotional interactions continuously, and (3) adaptive selections of group regulatory behaviors. The others showed dormant interactions throughout the projects and least socio-emotional interactions (named Passive Task-oriented Collaborator) and did not coordinate group process in a timely manner (named Late Collaborator). Comparisons of the interaction pattern and instructor intervention were discussed. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with affective issues in learning technologies in a collaborative context. Traditionally in learning there has been a division between cognition and affect: where cognition is concerned with skills and processes such as thinking and problem-solving and affect with emotional areas such as motivation, attitudes, feelings. Affective issues have been viewed as somewhat problematic in studying learning, so although it is well known that learner attitude, motivation, and emotional state are very important, they have often been excluded from the frame of research, or studied separately from cognitive learning. This position is gradually changing and this paper considers what previous research has been conducted in these areas. It discusses the role of affective factors in three main areas of collaboration: in settings where learners are co-located, in on-line communities and to support and develop socio-emotional skills. It considers relevant developments in these areas, what the outcomes have been and suggests important directions for future research. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

By examining natural communication between negotiators who use these media, we find that computer mediation reduces both the amount of affect communicated and concession, which in turn decreases the likelihood of agreement.

This study develops the idea that the emotion regulation abilities of team members affect how they manage task and relationship conflict, both as individuals and as a team. Findings from a field study involving 39 teams support the argument that individuals skilled in emotion regulation can take advantage of task conflict to perform effectively and limit the negative impact of relationship conflict. Groups that have individuals highly skilled in emotion regulation were also found to make good use of team conflict. Results suggest that emotion regulation skills contribute to the effective management of task conflict and relationship conflict at both individual and group levels.

abstract = {This paper presents a multifaceted qualitative investigation of everyday conflict in six organizational work teams. Repeated interviews and on-site observations provide data on participants' perceptions, behaviors, and their own analyses of their conflicts, resulting in a generalized conflict model. Model evaluation indicates that relationship conflict is detrimental to performance and satisfaction; process conflict is also detrimental to performance; and task conflict's effects on performance depend on specified dimensions. In particular, emotionality reduces effectiveness, resolution potential and acceptability norms increase effectiveness, and importance accentuates conflict's other effects. Groups with norms that accept task but not relationship conflict are most effective. The model and the findings help to broaden understanding of dynamics of organizational conflict and suggest ways it can either be alleviated or wisely encouraged. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) research has conventionally relied on measures, which treat SRL as an aptitude. To study self-regulation and motivation in learning contexts as an ongoing adaptive process, situation-specific methods are needed in addition to static measures. This article presents an ‘Adaptive Instrument for Regulation of Emotions' aimed at accessing students' experiences of individual and socially shared regulation of emotions in a socially challenging learning situation. The instrument, grounded in self-regulated and socially regulated learning theory, comprises four interrelated components: the socio-emotional challenges experienced in a collaborative learning situation; individual and group-level attempts to regulate the immediate emotions evoked by the challenges; the personal goals; and goal attainment pursued in that situation. The theoretical foundation of the instrument and its components are outlined and some reliability issues illustrated. The limitations but also educational potential of the instrument to understand regulation of emotions in socially challenging learning situations are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: During recent decades, self-regulated learning (SRL) has become a major research field. SRL successfully integrates the cognitive and motivational components of learning. Self-regulation is usually seen as an individual process, with the social aspects of regulation conceptualized as one aspect of the context. However, recent research has begun to investigate whether self-regulation processes are complemented by socially shared regulation processes. AIMS: The presented study investigated what kind of socio-emotional challenges students experience during collaborative learning and whether the students regulate the emotions evoked during these situations. The interplay of the emotion regulation processes between the individual and the group was also studied. SAMPLE: The sample for this study was 63 teacher education students who studied in groups of three to five during three collaborative learning tasks. METHOD: Students' interpretations of experienced social challenges and their attempts to regulate emotions evoked by these challenges were collected following each task using the Adaptive Instrument for the Regulation of Emotions. RESULTS: The results indicated that students experienced a variety of social challenges. Students also reported the use of shared regulation in addition to self-regulation. Finally, the results suggested that intrinsic group dynamics are derived from both individual and social elements of collaborative situations. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study support the assumption that students can regulate emotions collaboratively as well as individually. The study contributes to our understanding of the social aspects of emotional regulation in collaborative learning contexts.},

abstract = {The increasing amount of empirical research shows that the role of regulatory processes is critical in CSCL and collaborative learning settings. However, the current conceptual definitions and specificity of the findings vary. This is most probably because of limitations in the methods investigating regulated learning in a collaborative learning context. This study aimed to provide empirical evidence for how self- and shared regulation activities are used and whether they are useful for collaborative learning outcomes. Eighteen graduate students worked in collaborative groups for seven weeks in a CSCL course and the data of this study focuses on three one week online collaborative learning phases in the course. Temporal and sequential analysis of chat discussions and log file traces were matched to find evidence about whether the students' collaboratively planned regulatory activities became shared in practice. The results show evidence that collaborative planned regulatory activities become shared in practice. The groups that achieved good learning results used multiple regulatory processes to support their learning and also reached shared regulation. The four microlevel examples demonstrate simplified patterns of the activation of self-regulation and shared regulation. In conclusion, individual socially shared regulation plays a critical role in successful collaborative learning.},

It integrates SRL theory and the concept of engagement, including interaction in collaboration, as key characteristics of engagement. Forty-four second-year teacher education students worked in groups during a 7-week math didactic course. We collected 84 h of video recordings and coded the group's cognitive and socioemotional interaction and three phases of self-regulation within interaction, including forethought, performance and reflection. After that we analyzed the relationship between the interaction types representing collaborative engagement and SRL phases within two learning tasks. The results show that collaborative engagement did not differ between teacher-led and student-led tasks in terms of the interaction types. However, the results showed that the SRL phases occurred differently within cognitive and socioemotional interaction types when the two task conditions were compared. Findings concerning teacher-led tasks showed invariance in the occurrence of SRL phases across the task and highlighted the relationship between socioemotional interaction and the forethought phase. Additionally, findings concerning the student-led tasks showed systematic changes in the distribution of phases of SRL across sessions in all interaction types. Our results' theoretical and methodological implications for collaborative engagement research are discussed.},

This article examines the role of regulatory processes in collaborative learning and how CSCL environments can be used for shared regulation of learning. First, we establish the importance of regulation processes and introduce three types of regulation contributing to successful collaboration: self-, co-, and socially shared regulation of learning. Second, we illuminate two strands of seemingly diverse research that lay an important foundation for supporting and researching regulation in CSCL contexts establishing that (a) computer-based pedagogical tools used to successfully support regulation in individual learning contexts can be leveraged for collaborative task contexts, and (b) computer-based tools for supporting collaborative knowledge construction can be leveraged for supporting regulatory processes. Finally, we draw on emerging research in our own programs of research to demonstrate how regulation can be supported and researched in CSCL environments. The article concludes by charting a course for future CSCL research focused on supporting regulated learning in collaborative task contexts.},

abstract = {This study investigated how students collaborate in a CSCL environment and how this collaboration affects group performance. To answer these questions, the collaborative process of 101 groups of secondary education students when working on a historical inquiry task was analyzed. Our analyses show that group members devote most of their efforts to regulation of task-related activities. For example, by formulating plans or strategies or monitoring task progress. Group members also engaged in social activities often (e.g., disclosing personal information, joking). Less attention was paid to exchange of task-related information (e.g., asking task-related questions) and regulation of social activities (e.g., planning and monitoring the collaboration). Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the interrelationships between the different collaborative activities. This analysis showed that collaborative activities can be grouped in four broad categories: discussion of information, regulation of task-related activities, regulation of social activities, and social activities. These activities were then used to predict group performance using multiple regression analysis. No effect of discussion of information and regulation of task- related activities on group performance were found. Regulation of social activities positively affected group performance, whereas social interaction negatively affected group performance. As in this study no inferences could be made about the causal relation between collaboration and performance, future research should attempt to focus on this relationship, for example by investigating more closely how different individual and group factors affect collaboration and group performance.},

abstract = {This study investigated the effects of group member familiarity during computer-supported collaborative learning. Familiarity may have an impact on online collaboration, because it may help group members to progress more quickly through the stages of group development, and may lead to higher group cohesion. It was therefore hypothesized that increased familiarity would lead to (a) more critical and exploratory group norms, (b) more positive perceptions of online communication and collaboration, (c) more efficient and positive collaboration, and (d) better group performance. To investigate these hypotheses, 105 secondary education students collaborated in groups of three. The results of this study indicate that higher familiarity led to more critical and exploratory group norm perceptions, and more positive perceptions of online communication and collaboration. Furthermore, in familiar groups students needed to devote less time to regulating their task-related activities. The expectation that familiarity would lead to better group performance was not confirmed. These findings imply that online educators pay attention to the effects group member familiarity has on online collaborative learning. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

It is important, therefore, that users of systematic reviews know how much confidence they can place in the conclusions and recommendations arising from such reviews. In this paper we present an overview of some of the most influential systems for assessing the quality of individual primary studies and for grading the overall strength of a body of evidence. We also present an example of the use of such systems based on a systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development. Our findings suggest that the systems used in other disciplines for grading the strength of evidence for and reporting of systematic reviews, especially those that take account of qualitative and observational studies are of particular relevance for software engineering. },

abstract = {Background: The limitations of traditional forms of systematic review in making optimal use of all forms of evidence are increasingly evident, especially for policy-makers and practitioners. There is an urgent need for robust ways of incorporating qualitative evidence into systematic reviews. Objectives: In this paper we provide a brief overview and critique of a selection of strategies for synthesising qualitative and quantitative evidence, ranging from techniques that are largely qualitative and interpretive through to techniques that are largely quantitative and integrative. Results: A range of methods is available for synthesising diverse forms of evidence. These include narrative summary, thematic analysis, grounded theory, meta-ethnography, meta-study, realist synthesis, Miles and Huberman's data analysis techniques, content analysis, case survey, qualitative comparative analysis and Bayesian meta-analysis. Methods vary in their strengths and weaknesses, ability to deal with qualitative and quantitative forms of evidence, and type of question for which they are most suitable. Conclusions: We identify a number of procedural, conceptual and theoretical issues that need to be addressed in moving forward with this area, and emphasise the need for existing techniques to be evaluated and modified, rather than inventing new approaches. {\textcopyright} The Royal Society of Medicine Press Ltd 2005.},

abstract = {Context: Software productivity measurement is essential in order to control and improve the performance of software development. For example, by identifying role models (e.g. projects, individuals, tasks) when comparing productivity data. The prediction is of relevance to determine whether corrective actions are needed, and to discover which alternative improvement action would yield the best results. Objective: In this study we identify studies for software productivity prediction and measurement. Based on the identified studies we first create a classification scheme and map the studies into the scheme (systematic map). Thereafter, a detailed analysis and synthesis of the studies is conducted. Method: As a research method for systematically identifying and aggregating the evidence of productivity measurement and prediction approaches systematic mapping and systematic review have been used. Results: In total 38 studies have been identified, resulting in a classification scheme for empirical research on software productivity. The mapping allowed to identify the rigor of the evidence with respect to the different productivity approaches. In the detailed analysis the results were tabulated and synthesized to provide recommendations to practitioners. Conclusion: Risks with simple ratio-based measurement approaches were shown. In response to the problems data envelopment analysis seems to be a strong approach to capture multivariate productivity measures, and allows to identify reference projects to which inefficient projects should be compared. Regarding simulation no general prediction model can be identified. Simulation and statistical process control are promising methods for software productivity prediction. Overall, further evidence is needed to make stronger claims and recommendations. In particular, the discussion of validity threats should become standard, and models need to be compared with each other. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Two studies (Study 1: n= 137; Study 2: n= 192) were conducted to investigate how upper-elementary students' affect during small group instruction related to their social-behavioral engagement during group work. A circumplex model of affect consisting of valence (positive, negative) and activation (high, low) was used to examine the relation of affect to social loafing and quality of group interactions. Across both studies, negative affect (feeling tired or tense) was associated with higher rates of social loafing. Neutral to deactivated positive affect, such as feeling happy or calm, was positively related to positive group interactions, while deactivated negative affect (tired) was negatively associated with positive group interactions. Follow-up cross-lagged analyses to examine reciprocal relations suggested that positive group interactions altered affect on subsequent group tasks, but affect was not related to changes in positive group interactions. These quantitative findings were supplemented with a qualitative analysis of six small groups from Study 2. The qualitative analyses highlighted the reciprocal and cyclical relations between affect and social-behavioral engagement in small groups. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

Also, estimates for the required test execution effort can be an additional criterion for test selection, since effort may be restrictive in practice. Nevertheless, this information is usually not available for test cases never executed before. This paper proposes an estimation model for test execution effort based on the test specifications. For that, we define and validate a measure of size and execution complexity of test cases. This measure is obtained from test specifications written in a controlled natural language. We evaluated the model through an empirical study on the mobile application domain, which results suggested an accuracy improvement when compared with estimations based only on historical test productivity.},

It shows that NNs have good capabilities for representing complex nonlinear systems. NNs provide model-free learning controllers for a class of nonlinear systems in the sense that not even a structural or parametrized model of the system dynamics is needed. An overview of NNs is provided by the chapter following a discussion on the application of NNs to system identification. Multilayer NNs prove to be universal models for nonlinear systems. The network can learn the high-order mappings that occur in nonlinear series. Using control strategies, the network can replace the standard predictor in the internal control model and offer superior performance. The network can succeed in learning the complicated mappings of problems that are intractable to solve using standard estimation techniques. A comprehensive study is required to compare the NN model with other nonlinear models.},

For predicting numeric quantities, there has been work on combining these two schemes into 'model trees', i.e. trees that contain linear regression functions at the leaves. In this paper, we present an algorithm that adapts this idea for classification problems, using logistic regression instead of linear regression. We use a stagewise fitting process to construct the logistic regression models that can select relevant attributes in the data in a natural way, and show how this approach can be used to build the logistic regression models at the leaves by incrementally refining those constructed at higher levels in the tree. We compare the performance of our algorithm to several other state-of-the-art learning schemes on 36 benchmark UCI datasets, and show that it produces accurate and compact classifiers. 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

abstract = {Decision tree is one of the most popular and efficient technique in data mining. This technique has been established and well-explored by many researchers. However, some decision tree algorithms may produce a large structure of tree size and it is difficult to understand. Furthermore, misclassification of data often occurs in learning process. Therefore, a decision tree algorithm that can produce a simple tree structure with high accuracy in term of classification rate is a need to work with huge volume of data. Pruning methods have been introduced to reduce the complexity of tree structure without decrease the accuracy of classification. One of pruning methods is the Reduced Error Pruning (REP). To better understand pruning methods, an experiment was conducted using Weka application to compare the performance in term of complexity of tree structure and accuracy of classification for J 48, REPTree, PART, JRip, and Ridor algorithms using seven standard datasets from UCI machine learning repository. In data modeling, J48 and REPTree generate tree structure as an output while PART, Ridor and JRip generate rules. In additional J48, REPTree and PART using REP method for pruning while Ridor and JRip using improvement of REP method, namely IREP and RIPPER methods. The experiment result shown performance of J48 and REPTree are competitive in producing better result. Between J48 and REPTree, average differences performance of accuracy of classification is 7.1006{\%} and 6.2857{\%} for complexity of tree structure. For classification rules algorithms, Ridor is the best algorithms compare to PART and JRip due to highest percentage of accuracy of classification in five dataset from seven datasets. An algorithm that produces high accuracy with simple tree structure or simple rules can be awarded as the best algorithm in decision tree. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Collaborative learning (CL) can be a powerful method for sharing understanding between learners. To this end, strategic regulation of processes, such as cognition and affect (including metacognition, emotion and motivation) is key. Decades of research on self-regulated learning has advanced our understanding about the need for and complexity of those mediating processes in learning. Recent research has shown that it is not only the individual's but also the group's shared processes that matter and, thus, that regulation at the group level is critical for learning success. A problem here is that the “shared” processes in CL are invisible, which makes it almost impossible for researchers to study and understand them, for learners to recognize them and for teachers to support them. Traditionally, research has not been able to make these processes visible nor has it been able to collect data about them. With the aid of advanced technologies, signal processing and machine learning, we are on the verge of “seeing” these complex phenomena and understanding how they interact. We posit that technological solutions and digital tools available today and in the future will help advance the theory underlying the cognitive, metacognitive, emotional and social components of individual, peer and group learning when seen through a multidisciplinary lens. The aim of this paper is to discuss and demonstrate how multidisciplinary collaboration among the learning sciences, affective computing and machine learning is applied for understanding and facilitating CL.},

Although affective states and socio-emotional factors have an important effect on learning, few studies have classified and analyzed the results obtained by the scientific community to show their real impacts on in CSCL settings. The lack of a comprehensive overview and understanding of previous findings hampers the survey on research gaps, challenges and trends. This work addresses a systematic mapping of the literature for the summarization of results and discussion on research directions for the use of affective states and socio-emotional factors to support the development of intelligent CSCL environments. Six digital libraries were queried and 58 studies were deeply analyzed and categorized. Over 90{\%} of the studies considered emotion and personality traits in the CSCL environment; most studies used personality recognition by questionnaires rather than automatic sources of inference; most technological approaches employed instruments to collect, analyze and/or represent emotions; and most papers that reported empirical experiments focused on “emotional awareness” and “interaction among students in a CSCL environment”. We have identified three main challenges to be addressed by the community in the next decade for an adequate incorporation of affective states in CSCL environments: emotional awareness, orchestration of students' interaction and group formation.},

This article reports on the construction, reliability, internal validity, and external validity of the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire (AEQ) which is designed to assess various achievement emotions experienced by students in academic settings. The instrument contains 24 scales measuring enjoyment, hope, pride, relief, anger, anxiety, shame, hopelessness, and boredom during class, while studying, and when taking tests and exams. Scale construction used a rational-empirical strategy based on Pekrun's (2006) control-value theory of achievement emotions and prior exploratory research. The instrument was tested in a study using a sample of university students (N=389). Findings indicate that the scales are reliable, internally valid as demonstrated by confirmatory factor analysis, and externally valid in terms of relationships with students' control-value appraisals, learning, and academic performance. The results provide further support for the control-value theory and help to elucidate the structure and role of emotions in educational settings. Directions for future research and implications for educational practice are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Shuman2013,
abstract = {The distinction between the positive and the negative is fundamental in our emotional life. In appraisal theories, in particular in the component process model of emotion (Scherer, 1984, 2010), qualitatively different types of valence are proposed based on appraisals of (un)pleasantness, goal obstructiveness/conduciveness, low or high power, self-(in)congruence, and moral badness/goodness. This multifaceted conceptualization of valence is highly compatible with the frequent observation of mixed feelings in real life. However, it seems to contradict the one-dimensional conceptualization of valence often encountered in psychological theories, and the notion of valence as a common currency used to explain choice behavior. Here, we propose a framework to integrate the seemingly disparate conceptualizations of multifaceted valence and one-dimensional valence by suggesting that valence should be conceived at different levels, micro and macro. Micro-valences correspond to qualitatively different types of evaluations, potentially resulting in mixed feelings, whereas one-dimensional macro-valence corresponds to an integrative "common currency" to compare alternatives for choices. We propose that conceptualizing levels of valence may focus research attention on the mechanisms that relate valence at one level (micro) to valence at another level (macro), leading to new hypotheses, and addressing various concerns that have been raised about the valence concept, such as the valence-emotion relation. {\textcopyright} 2013 Shuman, Sander and Scherer.},

Sentiment analysis brings together various research areas such as natural language processing, data mining and text mining, and is fast becoming of major importance to organizations as they integrate online commerce into their operations. This paper proposes improved methods for aspect-level sentiment analysis. We propose to utilize bag of nouns instead of bog of words to improve the clustering results for aspect identification and a new feature set, score representation, that leads to more accurate sentiment identification. This scheme is based upon the three scores (positive ness, neutral ness and negative ness) that are learned from the data for each term. Using this new score representation scheme, we improve the performance of 3-class sentiment analysis on sentences by 20{\%} in terms of f1-measure, as compared to previously published research. We demonstrate the usefulness of the methodology using data from the popular online travel information site TripAdvisor.com. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Sentiment analysis, which addresses the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has received considerable attention in recent years. In contrast to the traditional coarse-grained sentiment analysis tasks, such as document-level sentiment classification, we are interested in the fine-grained aspect-based sentiment analysis that aims to identify aspects that users comment on and these aspects' polarities. Aspect-based sentiment analysis relies heavily on syntactic features. However, the reviews that this task focuses on are natural and spontaneous, thus posing a challenge to syntactic parsers. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a framework of adding a sentiment sentence compression (Sent-Comp) step before performing the aspect-based sentiment analysis. Different from the previous sentence compression model for common news sentences, Sent-Comp seeks to remove the sentiment-unnecessary information for sentiment analysis, thereby compressing a complicated sentiment sentence into one that is shorter and easier to parse. We apply a discriminative conditional random field model, with certain special features, to automatically compress sentiment sentences. Using the Chinese corpora of four product domains, Sent-Comp significantly improves the performance of the aspect-based sentiment analysis. The features proposed for Sent-Comp, especially the potential semantic features, are useful for sentiment sentence compression.},

These tasks were performed at different levels of analysis ranging from the document level, to the sentence and phrase level. Another task is aspect extraction which originated from aspect-based sentiment analysis in phrase level. All these tasks are under the umbrella of SA.

This survey aims to categorize SA techniques in general, without focusing on specific level or task. And also to review the main research problems in recent articles presented in this field. We found that machine learning-based techniques including supervised learning, unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning techniques, Lexicon-based techniques and hybrid techniques are the most frequent techniques used. The open problems are that recent techniques are still unable to work well in different domain; sentiment classification based on insufficient labeled data is still a challenging problem; there is lack of SA research in languages other than English; and existing techniques are still unable to deal with complex sentences that requires more than sentiment words and simple parsing.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG. Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) can give many benefits to students such as promoting creativity and sense of community, sharing abilities, etc. However, when groups of people work together, conflict is inevitable. Generally, conflict in any CSCL situation is uncomfortable, time consuming and counterproductive. It is hard to characterize a conflict because it can involve many factors – e.g., environmental factors, member's differences, etc. This paper proposes a technique to recognize conflicts in a group and the members involved in them by focusing in the socio-emotional interactions. As disagreements between group members generally cause negative emotions, and members can induce negative emotions to other members; then, a conflict between two or more members can be recognized when there are bidirectional negative messages in the same conversation thread. The proposed technique represents chat interactions as a digraph in which the nodes represent users and the edges indicate the transference of negative sentiments during the interactions. Then, a matrix of scaled commute times is used to detect clusters (subgroups having conflict). The validation of the technique shows promising results. The proposed technique is able to detect conflicts automatically, reducing the human effort required to detect these conflicts by other means.},

abstract = {Affect is basic to many if not all psychological phenomena. This article examines 2 of the most fundamental properties of affective experience-valence and arousal-asking how they are related to each other on a moment to moment basis. Over the past century, 6 distinct types of relations have been suggested or implicitly presupposed in the literature. We critically review the available evidence for each proposal and argue that the evidence does not provide a conclusive answer. Next, we use statistical modeling to verify the different proposals in 8 data sets (with Ns ranging from 80 to 1,417) where participants reported their affective experiences in response to experimental stimuli in laboratory settings or as momentary or remembered in natural settings. We formulate 3 key conclusions about the relation between valence and arousal: (a) on average, there is a weak but consistent V-shaped relation of arousal as a function of valence, but (b) there is large variation at the individual level, so that (c) valence and arousal can in principle show a variety of relations depending on person or circumstances. This casts doubt on the existence of a static, lawful relation between valence and arousal. The meaningfulness of the observed individual differences is supported by their personality and cultural correlates. The malleability and individual differences found in the structure of affect must be taken into account when studying affect and its role in other psychological phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Psychological Association.},
